/*!\brief Base class for non-creatable (static) classes.
// \ingroup util
//
// The NonCreatable class is intended to work as a base class for non-creatable classes, i.e.
// classes that cannot be instantiated and exclusively offer static functions/data. Both the
// standard as well as the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator are declared
// private and left undefinded in order to prohibit the instantiation of objects of derived
// classes.\n
//
// \note It is not necessary to publicly derive from this class. It is sufficient to derive
// privately to prevent the instantiation of the derived class.

   \code
   class A : private NonCreatable
   { ... };
